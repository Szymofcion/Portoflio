          I'm coding since January 2022. My adventure has started with basic
          HTML and CSS understanding.At that time, I had completed Maika courses
          on Udemy. After that, I went to postgraduate studies in frontend where
          I learned Angular. Unfortunately, I realized that Angular doesn't
          really suit me. I bought courses from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and
          continued learning in react. I added typescript, redux and several
          styling frameworks to it
