        <p>
          I'm a Freelance Frontend Developer with passion to code and eager to
          learn.

          I'm coding since June 2023. My adventure has started with basic HTML
          and CSS understanding with various courses and projects. Then I jumped
          right into JS and after a month I understood basics and advanced
          features of this language. Now I master my React skills day by day.
